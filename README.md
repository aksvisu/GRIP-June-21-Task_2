# GRIP-June-21-Task_2
Prediction using Unsupervised ML. This task has been done as a part of the Spark Foundation GRIP June'21
--------------------------------------------------
Task: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters 
and represent it visually. 
Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

K-means clustering is a unsupervised ML algorithm which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.

Algorithm:

Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.

Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).

Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.

Step-4: Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.

Step-5: Repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each cluster.

Step-6: If any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH.

Step-7: The model is ready.
